# CodeTrack: API

An app for keeping track of algorithm problems that you have solved online. Originally I used to use a spreadsheet to keep track of my progress. But I decided to make an app because why not xD

This is the restful API repo. There will be a mobile repo and a web repo.
### Tech stack:
* Nodejs
* Express
